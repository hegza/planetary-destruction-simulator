## Install
Install Rust toolchain by following the instructions at [www.rustup.rs/]().

## Run
The project requires you to have the isosurface-library in the same parent
directory as this project. I'm using a custom version of isosurface locally,
but the required changes can be made based on compiler complaints.

Then:
```
cargo run
```

## Logging
`export RUST_LOG=warn,ds_sim=TRACE`

## Contributing
I do not accept contributions as of yet, due to this being a personal course work for me. This will change after the work has been submitted.
